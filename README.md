# NAMCShiny

## An interactive web application to explore the primary reason for medical visits based on the 2003-2010 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey results

The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) is a national survey designed to meet the need for objective, reliable information about the provision and use of ambulatory medical care services in the United States. Results are based on a sample of visits to non-federal employed office-based physicians who are primarily engaged in direct patient care.

We encourage further exploration of NAMCS data to identify potential trends in public health and guide the development of future health policies.

- Bug in y-axis of plot if too few counts?
